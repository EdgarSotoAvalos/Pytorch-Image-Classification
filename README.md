This repository contains code for preprocessing a set of images downloaded from Kaggle. The objective is to preprocess these images to create a dataset suitable for training a neural network architecture, specifically TinnyVGG, using PyTorch.

# Introduction
Kaggle is a popular platform for data science and machine learning enthusiasts, offering various datasets for practice and competitions. However, the raw datasets may not always be in a format suitable for direct consumption by machine learning models. Preprocessing is often necessary to clean, standardize, and transform the data into a usable form.

In this exercise, we focus on preprocessing a set of images obtained from Kaggle. The preprocessing steps may include resizing, normalization, augmentation, and other transformations to prepare the images for training a neural network.

# Dependencies
To run the preprocessing code and train the TinnyVGG model, the following dependencies are required:

Python 3.x
PyTorch
torchvision
NumPy
Matplotlib
